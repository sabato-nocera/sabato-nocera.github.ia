Hi! I am Sabato Nocera, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/en/university), Italy, advised by [Prof. Rita Francese](https://docenti.unisa.it/004763/home) and [Prof. Simone Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/simoneromano/home?authuser=0). At the same university, I received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science in September 2022 and 2020, respectively. 

My research interests are in Empirical Software Engineering and involve **Software Security** and **Software Bill of Materials**.
