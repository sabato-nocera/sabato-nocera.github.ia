Description
======

MSR4SBOM is a project that aims to deliver a framework that analyzes the content of software repositories and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) to provide context-sensitive recommendations.
MSR4SBOM will support software engineers with:
* Managing dependencies in software supply chains;
* Tracking the provenance of software components and source code;
* Detecting licensing issues;
* Providing security recommendations for vulnerable dependencies.
