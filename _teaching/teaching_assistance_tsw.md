Since 2021, I have been a tutor for the _Software Technologies for the Web_ course (held in the second year of the Computer Science program at the University of Salerno).

Description
======

I conducted lectures and practical exercises to support students in developing the course project, a web application built using technologies such as Java (Servlet, JDBC, JSP, JSTL), JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX), HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Git (GitHub), SonarCloud, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
